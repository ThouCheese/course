`Encapsulation` is the process of combining sematically related data 
into single entities. In C++, this is most commonly achieved through 
classes and struct.

`Data hiding` is the process where the interface of a class does not 
expose the internal data, but rather the functionality derived from that 
data. This allows the user to focus solely on using the class without 
being bothered by the actual implementation of the class.

The implementation is irrelevant because of the above, that is, the 
purpose of a class is to not reveal the implementation to the user.
