When the programs are run with the if statement commented in and out (in that order), the results are:

[luuk@arch_desktop 58]$ time ./program 100000000

real    0m0.161s
user    0m0.161s
sys 0m0.000s
[luuk@arch_desktop 58]$ g++ *.cpp -o program
[luuk@arch_desktop 58]$ time ./program 100000000

real    0m1.994s
user    0m1.994s
sys 0m0.000s
