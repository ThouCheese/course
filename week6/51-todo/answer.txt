New: \\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item new / new[]: To allocate memory of any data type, for instance: int *p = new int; Used when we need a pointer to persistent data, that does not get destroyed as the position that created it goes out of scope.
    \item new(placement) / new(placement)[]: Takes an already allocated piece of memory and initializes it.
    \item operator new / operator new[]: Allocates a new piece of memory without initializing it.
\end{enumerate}
With every variant of operator new we need a corresponding delete.\\
Delete:\\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item delete p / delete p[]: delete all memory and return it to the os.
    \item there is not corresponding deletion operator to new(placement), as it does not allocate memory. Instead, call the destructor.
    \item operator delete / operator delete[]: returns the referred memory to the os without calling the destructor.
\end{enumerate}
