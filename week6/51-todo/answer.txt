1. placement new/placement delete
Does not allocate new memory, expects memory to be prealloacted. Useful for 
copying data to a new loaction, where the new location is allocated already,
but initialization at that location is not necessary. e.g.:
```
// snippet
string *mem = get_lotsa_memory();
for (size_t index = 0; index != some_size; ++index)
    new(ptr + index * sizeof(string)) string("hi!");
// usage
for (size_t index = 0; index != some_size; ++index)
    mem[index].~string;
```
