1. The main difference is that an array cannot be incremented the way a pointer 
can to get the next element. Arrays are immutable, pointers are mutable.

2. References cannot be re-assigned, point to NULL, be explicitly dereferenced 
or be incremented to the next value in memory, whereas pointers can do all these
things.

4. The pointer arithmetic is a small subset of arithmetic operations that are allowed on numbers. It is restricted to ++, --, + and -. These operations are allowed on pointers. It also concerns itself with which type of operands are allowed and whether these operations return a number or another pointer.

5. It is preffered to access an element using a pointer as opposed to an index expression because pointers are generally faster.
