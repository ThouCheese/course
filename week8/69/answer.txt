The results are

```
constructed
move constructed
copy assigned
move assigned
destructed
destructed
```

Note that constructed is only printed once, so our copy elision works! Thereafter our program produces output that does exactly as expected. Note that this is not a example of correct code, as it contains a use-after-move, but it works for our demonstration purposes.
